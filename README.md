# New-Congestion-control-TCP-stack
Develope new TCP congestion control algorithm that achieved up to full network bandwidth utilization in the presence of wireless connections and long delay times. The algorithm achieved high throughput/goodput gain over TCP - NewReno and TCP â€“ Cubic (Default in Linux). (TCP FTAT - OHIO LINK)
